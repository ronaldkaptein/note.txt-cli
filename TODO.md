A list of things I want to implement in the future, also for my own reference, in 
the order of importance:

- Allow to specify in which directory a new note goes
- Allow to specify multiple queries (AND), e.g by doing -q QUERY1 -q QUERY2
- Allow to search only in a specific subdirectory
- Make number of notes in history configurable
- Align list output better, e.g. as in 'tree' output, for better readability

IMPLEMENTED:
- 161107: Allow to specify which filetype/extensions to list (now only .txt)
- 161107: Allow to specify the default filetype/extension for new notes (now .txt)
- 170912: Move existing note to other folder
- 170912: Add option to automatically insert header with date and time after opening
- 170912: Allow to turn of full-text search, when listing becomes slow
- 170912: Add option to change default action when no arguments are given
- 170912: Allow to specify filename for open action instead of number
